### 4-Code-Quiz
Assignment 4: Code Quiz

## Functionality
I have managed to get the Code Quiz to work up until the Highscores page, using dynamic styling of the html, event delegation and functions. I haven't been able to get the highscores page to work within the time given and need to spend some more time learning how to save data to local storage. Other than that, I believe I have met all the other acceptance criteria.
